I am a final-year PhD student working in the School of Data Science at Fudan University. I am a member of [Data Intelligence and Social Computing Lab (DISC Lab)](http://fudan-disc.com/), advised by [Zhongyu Wei](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Fudan University. During my PhD, I've also spent time with [the Intelligence and Knowledge Discovery (INK) Research Lab](https://ink-usc.github.io/)  at University of Southern California, advised by [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/). I focuses on the alignment of Qwen-VL. Up to now, He has published several papers in the world top conferences such as ACL, NAACL, NeurIPS, AAAI and IJCAI.

My primary research interests include **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**, with a focus on vision-language research including large model and agents.
